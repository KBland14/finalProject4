    <p>Hello everyone!! I decided to keep with the same theme I've been doing, and using my resin projects as my images for my website. They are not perfect, but I am proud of the way them came out. I hope your like them, and maybe they will inspire some creativity.</p>

    <p>Most of these project was done with nothing but resin. There are a few on here not fully resin. The canvas is just a blank canvas with a design painted on it and then covered in resin to seal it. The disney ears have glow in the dark rocks in it, so it glows. The rose is wood but I painted the inside and then filled it with resin to seal it. The eggs was made with a different medium, (plaster) but it works just like resin just quicker.</p>
